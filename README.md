# Zoo Functions

The Zoo Functions is a project developed to simulate the functionalities of a zoo, allowing manipulation and display of information about different animals. The system contains details about the animals present at the zoo, employees, operating hours, and a pricing table that varies according to the age of visitors.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- **List animals:** Displays the list of all animals present at the zoo.
- **List employees:** Displays the list of employees working at the zoo.
- **Display and show hours:** Shows the hours of operation for each part of the zoo.
- **Calculate average age:** Calculates and displays the average age of all animals in the zoo.

## Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript**
- **ESLint**

## Key Learnings

During the development of this project, I explored JavaScript programming concepts, using logic to develop a zoo management system, and learning how to apply clean code practices with ESLint.

## Conclusion

Zoo Functions provides a virtual zoo simulation where users can search for animals, employees, and operating hours, as well as calculate the average age of the animals. It was a great opportunity to learn and practice JavaScript programming and clean code!
